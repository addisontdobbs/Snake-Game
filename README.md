# Snake-Game
This is a final project I created for my Computer Programming 1 class at the University of Alaska Anchorage. This is a simple console-based Snake game written in C++ using basic game logic and keyboard input handling. The game is structured within a Game class, which manages the game loop, rendering, and player interactions.
